## Development Workflow

### Branch Strategy

We follow the **Git Flow** model:

```
main              ← Production (deployed to gifav.veinpal.com)
├── develop       ← Integration branch
│   ├── feat/*    ← New features
│   ├── fix/*     ← Bug fixes
│   ├── refactor/* ← Code restructuring
│   ├── chore/*   ← Dependencies/tooling
│   ├── ci/*      ← CI/CD changes
│   └── docs/*    ← Documentation
└── release/x.y.z ← Release preparation
```

1. **Create** a feature branch from `develop`: `git checkout -b feat/my-feature develop`
2. **Work** on your changes, committing frequently
3. **Open a PR** from your branch into `develop`
4. **CI runs** automatically (lint, typecheck, build, security)
5. After review and approval, the PR is merged into `develop`

### Conventional Commits

All commits **must** follow [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/):

```
feat: add SVG paste support
fix: handle corrupted PNG gracefully
refactor: extract icon encoder to separate module
chore: update Tailwind CSS to v4
ci: add Playwright E2E tests
docs: improve contributing guide
test: add unit tests for ICO encoder
perf: optimize canvas rendering for large images
```

## Coding Standards

### TypeScript

- **No `any`** — use proper types, generics, or `unknown` with type guards.
- Prefer `interface` for object shapes, `type` for unions/intersections.
- Use `readonly` on properties that should never be mutated.

### React

- Functional components only.
- Prefer `useMemo` / `useCallback` for expensive computations and stable references.
- Keep components focused — one responsibility per component.

### Styling

- Tailwind CSS utility-first approach.
- Keep class strings readable — break long ones across multiple lines.

### File Organization

- Keep files small and focused (200–400 lines typical, 800 max).
- Functions under 50 lines — extract helpers when exceeding.
- No deep nesting (>4 levels — use early returns).

### Imports

- Group imports: external deps → local modules.
- Use absolute paths where configured.
